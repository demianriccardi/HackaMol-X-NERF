# HackaMol-X-NERF
Very preliminary and far from complete!

Goals:
1. An extension that makes it easy to build molecules.
2. implement a more flexible z-matrix that has arrays of variables
3. build sidechains from sidechain (may lead to interface with Sqwrl4)
4. add hydrogens to molecules by searching bonds 
5. add hydrogens to amino acids fast
